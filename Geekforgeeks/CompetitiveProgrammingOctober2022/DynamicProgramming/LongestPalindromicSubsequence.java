/** This another variation of LCS
 * We are given a string, we need to find out the longest subsequence of the 
 * string which is palindrone
 * Example
 * Str = "GEEKSFORGEEKS"
 * One solution is to make the current string i.e str as S1 and you make another string
 * out of it, which is the reverse of it S2 = "SKEEGROFSKEEG". then you can now find the 
 * LCS of SI and S2 and what ever that is the length of LCS of S1 and S2, that is your
 * longest palindromic subsequence length for the given string.
