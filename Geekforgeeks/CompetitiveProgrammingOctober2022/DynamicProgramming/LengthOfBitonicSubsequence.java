/**
 * Longest Bitonic Subarray Problem
 * The Longest Bitonic Subarray (LBS) problem is to find a subarray of a given sequence in which 
 * the subarrayâ€™s elements are first sorted in increasing order, then in decreasing order, and the 
 * subarray is as long as possible. Strictly ascending or descending subarrays are also accepted.
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4vMVTp6AuI
 * The problem differs from the problem of finding the longest bitonic subsequence. Unlike subsequences, 
 * subarrays are 
 * required to occupy consecutive positions within the original array.
The idea is to maintain two arrays, I[] and D[]:

I[i] store the length of the longest increasing subarray, ending at arr[i].
D[i] store the length of the longest decreasing subarray, starting from arr[i].
Finally, the length of the longest bitonic subarray is maximum among all I[i] + D[i] - 1. We can also 
keep track of two endpoints of the longest bitonic subarray found so far to print LBS.
